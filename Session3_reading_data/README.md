# Reading data into R and data visualization

In this session we will highlight the use of the [imcRtools](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/imcRtools) and the [cytomapper](https://github.com/BodenmillerGroup/cytomapper) R/Bioconductor packages to read in `steinbock` generated data into R.
The session will also teach different ways of data visualization and data quality control.

To follow the Session please make sure you followed the instructions in the [Setup](../Setup) and [data](../data) folders.

Before getting started, open `RStudio` and in the upper right corner click on `Project: (None)` > `Open Project...` and select the `path/to/ImagingWorkshop2023/ImagingWorkshop2023.Rproj` file.

Now you are set to open the `Session3.Rmd` file and follow the tutorial.
